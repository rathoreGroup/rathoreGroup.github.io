	<h1> Conservation </h1>
	<p> Each spring vast flocks of songbirds migrate north from Mexico to the United States, but since the 1960s their numbers have fallen by <mark>up to</mark> 50 percent. <img src="mexico.jpg"> </img> Frog population around the world has declined in <mark>recent</mark> years. The awe-inspiring California condor <img src=condor.jpg> </img> survives today only because of <mark>breeding program</mark> in zoos. These are only a few of species of life on Earth whose continued existence is in question, indeed, many scientists say that the Earth's biological <mark>diversity</mark>, or biodiversity, is growing 
	more fragile with each passing year. </p>



	<p> <mark>"Biodiversity"</mark> is a relatively new word. It encompasses not just individual species but the relationship between species and their habitats, weather that habitats  be a few acres of rain-forest or on entire ocean touching several continents. Increasingly, scientists are studying whether various habitats, and the species they harbour, can survive the massive changes that human beings have wrought on the plants, particularly in clearing forests and plants for agriculture and ranching. <mark>Harvarh University biologist Edward O. Wilson</mark>, one of the learning authorities on biodiversity, estimates that the world could lose 20percent of all existing species by the years 2020.</p>
	<p>It present trents continues, these species will not fade into extinction one by one but in large groups, in what <mark>Wilson</mark> calls mass <mark>extinctions</mark>. These is evidence that such sweeping disappearances may already be occurring or may be about to occur. Half of the freshwaters-fish species ones found in peninsular Malaysiahave become extinct, as have half of 41 type of trees <mark>snails</mark> native to <mark>Oatu</mark> in the Hamaiian Islands. Of the 68 varieties of shallow-water mussels once found along tho shoals of the <mark>Tennessee Rivers</mark>, 44 are though to be extinct. And when just one riped out. If the Earth is an ark carrying all living things, the <mark>British environmentalist Norman Myers</mark>. has said, then it is a sinking ark.</p>
	<p><mark>Nations and conservation organisations</mark> are responding to such alarms with a wide variety of laws, programs, and techniques individual species from becoming extinct but to defend unique ecosystem, especially the toipcal rain forests, which support an abundance of life.</p>
